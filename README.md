# ReminderToast
 Multifunctional task reminder using Windows Toast notifcations
## About
This program will allow you to create reminders for tasks and once the time has come, will push a Windows Toast Notification.

You may also disable the reminder temporarily by unchecking the entry in the list. Or you can just Remove it.

To modify a reminder, simply select the entry and press Modify. Make your changes and press Confirm.

This program will automatically roll-forward your reminders to the current day if your PC is not on and the current day is ahead of the reminders day.
In addition to the day, if the time of the day is also behind, that will also be set to the next possible instance of your chosen recurrence interval.

For example: A reminder is set to reoccur every 4 hours starting at 8pm. You shut off your PC and turn it on the next day at 3:00pm. The reminder will be set to the next day AND at 4:00pm and works like this (8:00pm -> 12:00am -> 4:00am -> 8:00am -> 12:00pm -> 4:00pm. Stops at 4:00pm since the time is 3:00pm.

Lastly, you can choose to have your own sound used (WAV/MP3 preferred) instead of the default Windows sound.
